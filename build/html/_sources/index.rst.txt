ChIA-PET V3 Tool: ChIA-PET, HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data analysis tool
==================================================================

.. image:: media/BatMeth2-pipeline.jpg

Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tag (ChIA-PET) sequencing is a technology to study genome-wide long-range chromatin interactions bound by protein factors. ChIA-PET Tool V3, a software package for automatic processing of ChIA-PET sequence data, including:

1. linker filtering for ChIA-PET and BL-HiChIP data
2. mapping the paired-end reads to a reference genome
3. purifying the mapped reads
4. dividing the reads into different categories
5. peak calling
6. interaction/loop calling
7. visualizing the results

**Installation**

* Please download and install the tools (see :doc:`function/install`)

The functions you can use CPT3 to do:

* :doc:`function/Linkerfilter`: linker filtering for ChIA-PET and BL-HiChIP data
* :doc:`function/Alignment`: Align paired-end reads
* :doc:`function/PETdivide`: dividing the reads into different categories
* :doc:`function/peakcall`: peak calling with MACS2
* :doc:`function/loopcall`: interaction/loop calling 
* :doc:`function/loopcall`: visualizing the results and report a html

While developing CPT3, we continuously strive to create software
that fulfills the following criteria:

-  raw fastq/fastq.gz reads quality control with or without linker filter and **efficiently alignment**
-  **dividing the PETs into different categories** for ChIA-PET or HiChIP data.
-  **calling peaks** with MACS2 or SPP methods.
-  efficiently **calling loops**
-  generation of **highly customizable visulization**
